## About Me

I'm a Computer Science student who genuinely enjoys building systems from the ground up especially the data models, edge cases, failure handling, and performance trade-offs.

Backend is where I feel most at home designing APIs, structuring databases carefully, and thinking about scalability before it becomes a problem.

Focused on backend systems, database design, and architecture rather than demo projects.

I care about understanding *why* systems behave the way they do not just making features work.

Currently looking for **Summer 2026 internships** where I can learn from strong engineers, contribute meaningfully, and grow into a solid backend developer.

---

## What I Care About

- Writing backend code that is maintainable, observable, and resilient  
- Designing relational schemas with proper indexing and constraints  
- Clear API contracts and predictable system behavior  
- Security, performance, and operational visibility from day one  
- Shipping real systems — not just tutorial demos  
- Understanding trade-offs between consistency, latency, and scalability  

---

## Currently Exploring

- Building microservices in Go to better understand distributed systems behavior  
- Learning Spring Boot and enterprise backend patterns  
- Strengthening system design fundamentals  
- Contributing to open-source projects when I can
